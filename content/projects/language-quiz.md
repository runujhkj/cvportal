title: "Language Quiz (PySide6)"
status: "Active"
summary: "A minimal desktop vocabulary drill tool for multiple scripts and languages."
tech: ["Python", "PySide6", "JSON"]
problem: "I wanted a fast, offline way to drill vocabulary across multiple languages and writing systems without dealing with heavy web stacks or subscription platforms."
approach: "A dictionary-driven PySide6 app where each quiz is generated from simple JSON word lists. The UI focuses on fast repetition, minimal friction, and script support for العربية, русский, 日本語 (kana), and others."
current:
  - "Loads multi-language dictionaries stored as JSON files."
  - "Provides a quiz interface with typed answers and immediate feedback."
  - "Supports right-to-left scripts and non-Latin character input."
  - "Includes a debug mode to validate dictionary entries."
next:
  - "Add per-word statistics (streaks, last-seen, error rate)."
  - "Implement spaced-repetition scheduling."
  - "Export/import dictionaries to share vocab decks."
repo_status: "Private for now; available on request."
