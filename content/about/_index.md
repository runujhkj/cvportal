I work mostly in the space where systems have to stay up even when they really don’t want to.

Professionally, that’s Linux-based high-performance computing: Slurm, node triage, firmware and BIOS coordination, and small tools that make cluster behaviour more visible. A lot of my day-to-day work is about turning vague complaints (“the jobs are slow”, “this node is weird”) into concrete, diagnosable states.

On my own time I tend to build similar things at smaller scale:  
a scripted Kubernetes lab (vkube), a VPN-LAN router architecture (vplan), a node triage dashboard (NodeBoard), and a language quiz app I use to drill العربية, 日本語, русский, español, and others. The common thread is making complex behaviour more predictable and less annoying to work with.

I’m happiest when I can:

- Remove manual, fragile steps from recurring processes.
- Give myself better visibility into what a system is doing and why.
- Leave behind scripts and documentation that a future version of me can understand at a glance.

If you’re looking at this site because of a CV or application, the short version is: I like infrastructure, I like automation, and I try to keep my tools honest about what actually works today and what’s still in progress.
