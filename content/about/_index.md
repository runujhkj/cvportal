title: "About"

I work mostly in the space where systems have to stay up even when they really don’t want to.

Professionally, that’s Linux-based high-performance computing: Slurm, node triage, firmware and BIOS coordination, and small tools that make cluster behavior more visible. A lot of the job is turning vague complaints into diagnosable states.

On my own time I build similar things at smaller scale: a scripted Kubernetes lab (vkube), a VPN-LAN router architecture (vplan), a node triage dashboard (NodeBoard), and a language quiz app for drilling العربية / 日本語 / русский / español. The common thread is repeatability and visibility.

## Photos

<div class="about-photo-grid">

  <figure class="about-figure">
    <img
      src="{{< staticurl "img/about/me.jpg" >}}"
      alt="Photo of me"
      class="about-photo"
      loading="lazy"
    >
    <figcaption class="about-caption">
      Caption: This is what I look like.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="about-figure">
    <img
      src="{{< staticurl "img/about/we.jpg" >}}"
      alt="Photo of me and my wife"
      class="about-photo"
      loading="lazy"
    >
    <figcaption class="about-caption">
      Caption: This is what I look like standing by the most important thing in my life..
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

</div>
