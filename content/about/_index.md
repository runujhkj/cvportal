title: "About"

I work mostly in the space where systems have to stay up even when they really don’t want to.

Professionally, that’s Linux-based high-performance computing: Slurm, node triage, firmware and BIOS coordination, and small tools that make cluster behavior more visible. A lot of the job is turning vague complaints into diagnosable states.

On my own time I build similar things at smaller scale: a scripted Kubernetes lab (vkube), a VPN-LAN router architecture (vplan), a node triage dashboard (NodeBoard), and a language quiz app for drilling العربية / 日本語 / русский / español. The common thread is repeatability and visibility.

## Photos

<div class="about-photo-grid">

{{< photocard
    src="img/about/me.jpg"
    alt="Photo of me"
    caption="Caption: What I look like."
>}}

{{< photocard
    src="img/about/we.jpg"
    alt="Photo of me and my wife"
    caption="Caption: What I look like standing next to the most important thing in my life."
>}}

</div>

## Other things I make

- experimental videos built from the Rantology avatar pipeline  
- short written pieces and micro-fiction  
- language notes from studying العربية / 日本語 / русский / español  
- occasional photography, usually in places that look slightly unreal
