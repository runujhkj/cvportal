I work primarily with Linux-based high-performance computing (HPC) systems, automation, and diagnostics.

Day-to-day that means: Slurm, Ansible, ReFrame, firmware/BIOS coordination, and a lot of cluster triage.  
Outside work, I build small tools to make my own infrastructure and learning less painful.
